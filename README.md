# BookCatalog.Api

A .NET8 API project to enable the following 

Create an application to manage a catalog of books. Each book will have a list of authors (that can be empty). At least the application must save the following information:
* Author: name, surname, birthyear
* Book: title, author list, publisher, edition, published date

PLEASE NOTE - I used http://localhost:8081 as Visual Studio devend.exe was already configured to use http://localhost:8080 ~ and I don't want to override this in all my other projects. 

ALSO ~ I have seeded the in memory data component on initialisation with 3 authors and 3 books. 

Swagger is configured for you to test the API endpoints.

Any questions please contact Paul Pishhorn @ either paulpish@hotmail.com or (+44) 07760 473408
